# Human-Following-Robot

I built an awesome robot using Arduino Uno and a motor shield. It uses two sensors, IR sensor and ultrasonic sensor. 

Here is a step-by-step guide for making the human-following robot using Arduino

Step 1: Gather the necessary components:
Arduino Uno
Motor shield
IR sensor
Ultrasonic sensor
DC motors and wheels
Battery and battery holder
Jumper wires
Acrylic sheet (for the robot's body)

Step 2: Construct the robot's body:
Cut the acrylic sheet into suitable pieces to create the base, sides, and front of the robot's body.

Step 3: Mount the sensors:
Attach the IR sensor and ultrasonic sensor to the front of the robot's body using screws or adhesive, ensuring they are securely in place.

Step 4: Connect the motor shield:
Connect the motor shield to the Arduino Uno, aligning the pins and making sure they are firmly connected.

Step 5: Connect the DC motors:
Connect the DC motors to the motor shield, ensuring the polarity of the connections is correct for each motor.

Step 6: Wire the sensors:
Connect the output pins of the IR sensor to suitable analog input pins on the Arduino Uno using jumper wires.
Connect the ultrasonic sensor to the appropriate analog pins on the Arduino Uno, referring to the sensor's datasheet or documentation for specific pin connections.

Step 7: Power the robot:
Connect the Li-ion battery to the battery holder.
Connect the battery holder to the power input of the motor shield.

Step 8: Program the Arduino Uno:
Write the Arduino code to read data from the IR sensor and ultrasonic sensor.
Upload the code to the Arduino Uno using the Arduino IDE.

Step 9: Test and calibrate:
Turn on the power switch of the robot.
Observe the robot's behavior as it detects and follows a person.
Make any necessary adjustments to the code or sensor positioning to improve the robot's performance.

Step 10: Iterate and refine:
Based on the results of testing, make any modifications or enhancements to the robot's design, sensors, or code.
Continue iterating and refining the robot until it achieves the desired functionality and performance.
